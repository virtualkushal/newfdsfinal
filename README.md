🌧️ Rain Prediction using Machine Learning ☀️

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data and machine learning models.

📂 Dataset

We use an Australian weather dataset with various meteorological features like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed to predict rainfall.

🔍 Data Preprocessing

✔️ Handling missing values ✅
✔️ One-hot encoding categorical variables 🎯
✔️ Feature scaling ⚖️
✔️ Feature selection 🔬

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Visualized distributions of weather features using Seaborn 📈
📌 Correlation heatmap to identify important features 🔥

🏆 Machine Learning Models Used

🔹 Random Forest 🌳
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors 🤖
🔹 Logistic Regression 📉

🚀 Model Evaluation

📌 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate model performance 🏅
📌 The best model was selected based on performance metrics 🥇

🎯 How to Use

Clone the repository: git clone <repo_url>

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 📦

Run the script: python rain_prediction.py ⏳

Enter weather conditions to get predictions! 🌦️

📌 Future Improvements
